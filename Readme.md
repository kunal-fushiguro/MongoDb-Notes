# Mongodb

### What is `Mongodb` ?

`Mongodb` is an open source, document oriented NoSql database management system.

### What is document database (document oriented) ?

A database that stores information in documents(JSON).

### Why `Mongodb` ?

It is designed for flexibility, scalability, and performance in handling unstructured or semi structured data.

### Comparing SQL and NoSql database

| They use structured tables to store data in rowa and columns.                  | They provide flexibility in data storage, allowing varied data types and structure. |
| Suitable for applications with well defined schemas and fixed data structures. | Ideal for application with dynamic or evolving data models.                         |
| Examples : MySql,PostgreSQL,Oracle.                                            | Examples: MongoDb,Cassandra,redis                                                   |
